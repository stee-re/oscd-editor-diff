  <h3>Base Comparison Rules Help</h3>

<p>Base rules apply to all rules.</p>

<p>One of the two groups of filters shown below will applied to each set of comparison rules on dependent rules. If a rule is set to "exclusive" mode (default), then the corresponding rule set from the "Exclude Rules" section will be applied. If a rule is set to "inclusive" mode, then the corresponding rule set from the "Include Rules" section will be applied.</p>

<p>The default settings are to ensure that naming identifiers don't prevent comparisons between objects (e.g. IEDs with a different name for example).
Use the "Reset" button in the footer to discard all saved changes and revert to the the defaults.</p>
