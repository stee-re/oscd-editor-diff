<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>
  The compare plugin allows for a complete comparison of two SCL documents and
  gives a hierarchial list of differences using the SCL structure shown in IEC
  61850-6.
</p>
<p>
  Users may compare only particular elements and specify these in considerable
  detail. Comparisons can occur between one or more documents. Pre-defined
  comparison rules are available for common use cases and users may create new
  comparison rules as well as export and import rules to allow them to be shared
  (the rules are saved as JSON files)
</p>
<p>
  Comparisons on large files may take a considerable time - 10-15 minutes on a
  high powered machine with 16 Gb RAM and no other browser tabs or applications
  open. SCL files for even small substations can have many hundreds of thousands
  of elements. Comparisons between files with only a small number of IEDs should
  take &lt; 10 seconds.
</p>
<p>
  It is recommended to create filters to ensure performant queries and targeted
  results.
</p>
<p>
  While the comparison is being done the user interface may become unresponsive,
  and a message asking whether the user would like to wait may come up. Either
  the user can click &quot;Wait&quot; or just ignore this message - the
  comparison will continue to occur in the background.
</p>
<p>
  Once a comparison is complete, click on the print icon on the left to either
  print or export to PDF. The full-screen button maximises the view to take up
  the full browser window.
</p>
<h3 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h3>
<p>
  At the top top, a set of predefined comparison rules for common tasks are
  provided. Click the three dots on the right to duplicate/delete or to
  import/export the filters.
</p>
<p>
  If using small files with only a few IEDs (e.g. SSD, ICD and CID files or SCD
  files with just a few IEDs) then choose the &quot;Complete&quot; filter.
</p>
<p>Then select the 'From' and 'To' documents.</p>
<p>
  The colours of the document icons here are used to show where the changes are,
  if changes are only in the first document colour it indicates removals and if
  changes are in the second document colour it indicates additions.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the &quot;Scope&quot; can be entered. On a predefined filters these
  can usually be left blank or at the filter defaults. By ticking the checkbox
  &quot;Separate From/To scopes&quot; the user can specify different scopes for
  the "From" and "To" documents.
</p>
<p>
  Click on &quot;Compare&quot; and wait for the comparison to be presented.
  Changing to another tab may mean the comparison is effectively paused so
  leaving the the window in focus is recommended.
</p>
<p>The output is shown in the normal SCL file structure:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">Header</span>
Substation
Communication
IED (one <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> more)
DataTypeTemplates
</code></pre>
<p>
  To understand each element it is recommended to look these up in IEC 61850-6
  or each manufacturer&#39;s documentation.
</p>
<h3 id="creating-filters">Creating comparison rules</h3>
<p>
  To create your own comparison rule, choose a similar rule and select the
  &quot;More&quot; option adjacent to the comparison rule selector (the three
  dots). Click on &quot;Duplicate&quot;. Then click on the &quot;More&quot;
  option and select &quot;Edit&quot;.
